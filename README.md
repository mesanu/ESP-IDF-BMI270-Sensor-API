BMI270 Sensor API

This package contains the sensor APIs for the BMI270 sensor in addition to build files and integrations for use as a component in an ESP IDF generated project.

Please note that the examples have been removed, as has support for the legacy BMI270 API. Please refer to the Bosch BMI270 API for for both.

This repo is a currently a work in a progress.

## Sensor Overview
The BMI270 is a small, low power, low noise inertial measurement unit designed for use in mobile applications like augmented reality or indoor navigation which require highly accurate, real-time sensor data.
